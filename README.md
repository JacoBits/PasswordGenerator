# PasswordGenerator

This code is for a password generator in C++, it uses the ranlux_24 prng to generate passwords depending on user choices. 
Please note that this is not really meant to be used as to generate passwords for your accounts. This code was made as a means of testing different random number generation methods other than rand(), and truncating the number with the modulo operator.
